        I’m Atul Sharma, a full‑stack developer focused on building reliable, scalable, and user‑centric products. I work primarily with React and Django, with experience spanning Python, Node.js, and modern tooling. I enjoy designing clean architectures, shipping performant interfaces, and iterating quickly with measurable impact. Currently pursuing MCA and open to opportunities where I can contribute hands‑on, learn deeply, and elevate the product experience end‑to‑end.
